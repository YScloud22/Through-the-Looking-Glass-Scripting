##### How to use this program

1. Assuming the repository is cloned, use the terminal and navigate with the command "cd" into the folder directory.
2. Use the command "clang-format -i -style=file *.c *.h" to format all c and h files into clang.
3. Use the command 'make'  to be able to compile the program.
4. Use the command "./hatterspeak" to begin giving an input.
5. Type in words and they will be parsed instinctly by a space.
6. After entering your words, press ctrl + D to parse the input.
7. If an invalid flag is given, then the program will return "error."

Notes: My makefile supports make clean, infer, and valgrind.
